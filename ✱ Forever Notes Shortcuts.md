1. [Copy Today Note Link to Clipboard](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/c4897a2465f74c98a9f7591f69035c72)
	This copies the link to the Today Note shortcut created by Matthias Hilse. I use it to make linking the Today note easier in the Journal.
2. [Today Note with Weather](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/773464e370a244afaea9d8c56d416188)
This pulls location, weather and time from the device and copies it to the clipboard. It then opens the Today Note in the Journal. I use this to add relevant meta data to the Journal notes.
